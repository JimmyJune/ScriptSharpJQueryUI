        The progress bar's widths are specified in percentages for flexible sizing so it
        will resize to fit its container. Try resizing the height and width of this bar
        to see how it maintains the correct proportions. (This is not necessarily a real-world
        example, but it's a good illustration of how flexibly all the plugins are coded.)</p>
